here actually adds both a membrane and a water box. It is best to build them together, both to avoid adding waters inside the membrane and to ensure that lipid head groups are properly solvated.\n","\n","#@markdown The algorithm is based on the one described in [Wolf et al., J. Comp. Chem. 31, pp. 2169-2174 (2010)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcc.21507). It begins by tiling copies of a pre-equilibrated membrane patch to create a membrane of the desired size. Next it scales down the protein by 50% along the X and Y axes. Any lipid within a cutoff distance of the scaled protein is removed. It also ensures that equal numbers of lipids are removed from each leaf of the membrane. Finally, 1000 steps of molecular dynamics are performed to let the membrane relax while the protein is gradually scaled back up to its original size.\n","\n","#@markdown **Parameters to generate the protein topology:**\n","\n","Force_field = \"AMBER14SB\" #@param [\"AMBER14SB\", \"AMBER99SB\", \"AMBER99SB-ILDN\"]\n","Water_type = \"TIP3P\" #@param [\"TIP3P\", \"SPC/E\"]\n","\n","#@markdown The size of the membrane and water box are determined by the minimumPadding argument.
